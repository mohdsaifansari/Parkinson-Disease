# Parkinson's Disease

The goal of this groundbreaking work is to create a viable prediction model for anticipating the wearing-off phenomena in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to deliver vital real-time information that can revolutionise treatment tactics and improve PD symptom management. This project centres around the painstaking collecting and processing of patient data, culminating in the building of a predictive model using the power of wearable devices and cutting-edge data analytic techniques. The basis of this endeavor is the combination of machine learning and deep learning approaches, which promise to uncover previously unknown patterns in data. The creation of a user-friendly interface, meant to democratise access to wearing-off forecasts, is a critical component of this endeavour. This interface facilitates improved clinical decision-making and patient care by ensuring smooth interaction with the model. What distinguishes this study is its persistent attention to clinical accuracy and relevance. Continuous monitoring and active engagement with healthcare specialists guarantee that the model fits the demands of medical practitioners effortlessly. Ultimately, this project aims to reshape the landscape of Parkinson's disease care, improving both patient quality of life and healthcare practitioners' capacity to manage the complexity of Parkinson's disease with accuracy and compassion.
